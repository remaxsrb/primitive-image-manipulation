# primitive-image-manipulation
Source code of my first serious work as a software engineering student written in C++ and in Java
Most of the work was done in c++ and as you can see that code is doing most of the work in the background while code in Java was mostly used for GUI developing. 

Essentialy, project had two stages, first one was to develop a console application which would take in user input and apply certain effects on loaded image files of .bmp and .pam formats. 
Second stage was to create a GUI for the underlying code and I've done it in JAVA. When a user choses to apply an effect or export an image onto the disk the GUI will execute already built and created .exe file (or files) depending on which action the user chose.
